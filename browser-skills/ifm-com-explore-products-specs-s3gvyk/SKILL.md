      Fallback only. The product page is a Vue SPA: the raw HTML shell contains
      NO spec values (they hydrate client-side from the same REST API). A
      rendered browser session reads the full spec table from the DOM but costs
      ~100x the REST path. Use a verified + residential-proxy Browserbase
      session if the REST host ever blocks direct fetches.

# ifm Products & Technical Specifications Explorer

## Purpose

Discover ifm electronic products (sensors, IO-Link devices, connectors, controllers, accessories) and retrieve their full technical specifications. ifm's public website (`www.ifm.com`) is a Vue single-page app that hydrates entirely from an unauthenticated REST API at `/restservices/{country}/{lang}/…`. This skill leads with that API: a search call to find product article numbers, then per-article calls for product metadata and the complete datasheet (every spec attribute, grouped into sections, with units). Read-only — no login, cart, or order actions.

## When to Use

- Look up the full technical datasheet for a known ifm article number (e.g. `PN2043`, `TN7531`, `O5D100`).
- Search the catalog for products matching a query ("pressure sensor", "IO-Link master") and return the matching article numbers + headlines.
- Bulk-extract specs across many products (the API is faster, cheaper, and structurally cleaner than scraping the rendered page).
- Compare spec attributes across a product family or category.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise drive the ifm SPA UI to read a spec table — the REST JSON is the same data the UI renders.

## Workflow

**Optimal path = direct REST calls.** The product page's raw HTML is a shell — it does **not** contain spec values (confirmed: a static fetch of `/us/en/product/PN2043` has no "Measuring range", "Operating voltage", etc.). Those values hydrate client-side from `/restservices/...`. Hit that API directly and skip the browser entirely.

Base path: `https://www.ifm.com/restservices/{cc}/{lang}/` where `{cc}` is the lowercase country code and `{lang}` the language (e.g. `us/en`, `de/de`, `gb/en`, `fr/fr`). Use `us/en` for the US English catalog.

All calls are plain HTTPS `GET`, return `application/json`, and need **no auth, cookies, or token**. In a Browserbase sandbox use `browse cloud fetch <url> --proxies` (a residential proxy is recommended for reliability — the bare ifm homepage returns 403 to naive clients — though the REST endpoints themselves returned 200 even without proxies in testing).

1. **Find products (search).**
   ```
   GET /restservices/us/en/search?q={url-encoded query}
   ```
   Returns: `resultList[]` (default ~12 product hits), `productCount` (total products matching, e.g. 1420), `solutionCount`, `otherCount` (accessories/downloads), and `facetResult.facets[]` for drill-down. Each `resultList[]` item carries `id` (the article number, e.g. `PN7094`), `productHeadline` (display name, e.g. "Pressure sensor with display"), `url` (`/us/en/product/{id}`), `shortDescription`, `bulletPoints[]`, `searchResultType` ("product"), `gtin`, and an image URL. Use `id` for the detail/datasheet calls below.

2. **Get product metadata.**
   ```
   GET /restservices/us/en/productdetail/{ARTICLE}
   ```
   Returns the product header object: `title` (= article number), `productHeadline` (descriptive name — **this, not `title`, is the human-readable product name**), `shortDescription`, `bulletPoints[]`, `productType` (the long ifm type string, e.g. `PN-040-SER14-MFRKG/US/ /V`), `gtin`, `countryOfOrigin`, `ioLinkUri`, `variantIds[]`/`variants[]`, `hasAccessories`, and image URLs. Note `price`/`formattedPrice` are usually `null` (US list/customer prices require a logged-in my-ifm session — see gotchas).

3. **Get the full technical specifications (datasheet).**
   ```
   GET /restservices/us/en/productdetail/datasheetTab/{ARTICLE}
   ```
   This is the core call. Returns:
   - `datasheetResultDocument.datasheetSections[]` — ordered spec sections. Each section has `sectionName` (e.g. "Product characteristics", "Electrical data", "Measuring/setting range", "Operating conditions", "Tests / approvals", "Mechanical data") and `datasheetSubSectionList[]`, each holding `dataSheetAttributesList[]`.
   - Every attribute is `{ "name": "Measuring range", "value": "0...40 bar", "uom": "", "type": "string", "key": "at_...", "valueList": null, "tableValue": null }`. Multi-unit values (bar/psi/MPa) may appear as separate adjacent attributes with the same `name`.
   - `defaultPdfDatasheetUrl` — direct link to the official PDF datasheet.
   - `scaleDrawingUrl` / `scaleDrawingRef` — dimensional drawing image.
   - `certificateImages[]`, `connections`, `diagramSections`, `freeTableSection`, `footerAddress`, `footerDate`, `madeInRemark`.
   To flatten: iterate `datasheetSections → datasheetSubSectionList → dataSheetAttributesList` and collect `{section, name, value, uom}`.

4. **(Optional) Related sub-resources** — same `productdetail/{tab}/{ARTICLE}` pattern, all JSON:
   - `productdetail/variants/{ARTICLE}` — variant list.
   - `productdetail/accessories/{ARTICLE}` — compatible accessories.
   - `productdetail/pdfDatasheets/{ARTICLE}` — datasheet PDFs in all languages.
   - `availability/{ARTICLE}/availability/1/ST?includeStock=true` — stock/availability.

### Browser fallback

Only if the REST host ever starts blocking direct fetches. Use a Browserbase session created with **`--verified --proxies`** (the homepage is behind Akamai and returns 403 to unstealthed clients):
1. `browse open https://www.ifm.com/us/en/product/{ARTICLE} --remote` then `browse wait timeout 5000` (let the SPA hydrate).
2. Dismiss the Usercentrics cookie banner — it lives in a **shadow DOM**, so `querySelector('button')` won't find "Accept All"; click it by coordinates (`browse mouse click 905 667` at 1288×711) instead.
3. The page lazy-loads the spec table when the **"Technical details"** tab is in view. `browse get text body` returns the entire rendered datasheet inline (section headers + name/value pairs), even before manual scrolling. Parse the text, or click the "Technical details" tab and read the rendered `<table>`s.
4. Note the rendered page reaches the same `/restservices/.../datasheetTab/{ARTICLE}` XHR — confirm the endpoint via `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` if you need to rediscover it.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The product page HTML has NO spec data.** `/us/en/product/{ART}` is a Vue SPA shell; specs hydrate from `/restservices/.../datasheetTab/{ART}`. Don't parse the static product HTML for specs — it only has `<meta>`/`og:` tags and the JS bundle. Hit the REST API.
- **`title` ≠ product name.** In `productdetail/{ART}`, `title` is just the article number (`"PN2043"`). The human-readable name ("Pressure sensor with display") is in **`productHeadline`**. The verbose ifm catalog type string is `productType`.
- **Locale is in the path, not a header.** `{cc}/{lang}` (e.g. `us/en`) selects catalog, language, units, and price region. `de/de`, `gb/en`, `fr/fr`, etc. all work. The same article returns localized spec strings per locale.
- **robots.txt disallows many locales' indexable pages** and query-string category URLs (`Disallow: /*/*/category/*/*/*?*`, plus most non-US/non-DE `/{cc}/en/` trees), but explicitly **Allows ClaudeBot / GPTBot / anthropic-ai / CCBot**. The `/restservices/` API is not disallowed. `us/en` and `de/en` are crawlable.
- **Search returns only ~12 results per call and there is no working offset/page param.** `productCount`/`hits` report the true total (e.g. 1420), but `page=`, `offset=`, `pageSize=`, `p=`, `count=` all returned **HTTP 503** in testing — do not rely on them. To enumerate a full category, either (a) narrow the query / use `facetResult.facets[]` buckets (e.g. `productProgram` → Sensors/Accessories with counts) to slice the result set, or (b) pull article numbers from the locale sitemap (see below).
- **Sitemap = the bulk product index.** `https://www.ifm.com/us/en/sitemap.xml` lists ~10,450 `/us/en/product/{ARTICLE}` URLs and ~800 `/us/en/category/{HIERARCHICAL_ID}` URLs (IDs like `200_010_020_010_010`). This is the most reliable way to enumerate every article number; the per-product REST calls then fetch metadata + specs. Other Sitemaps are listed in `robots.txt` (one per locale).
- **There is no `restservices/.../category/{id}` JSON endpoint** — `/restservices/us/en/category/230` returns 404. Category browsing is done via the SPA `/{cc}/{lang}/category/{id}` pages or via `search` + facets, not a clean category REST call.
- **Prices are usually `null` in the API.** `productdetail.price` / `formattedPrice` came back `null` for US; the rendered search UI shows a "List price" but "Your price" requires a logged-in my-ifm account. Treat pricing as out of scope / login-gated.
- **Multi-unit spec values are duplicated, not nested.** A pressure range appears as three sibling attributes (`0...40 bar`, `0...580 psi`, `0...4 MPa`) all named "Measuring range", rather than one attribute with a unit array. Group by `name` if you need them merged.
- **Homepage/anti-bot:** the bare `www.ifm.com` homepage is behind Akamai and returned **403** to the pre-run probe. `browse cloud fetch` (with or without `--proxies`) reached both the product HTML and the REST JSON at **200** in testing; the browser fallback needs `--verified --proxies` to load the SPA reliably. Recommend `--proxies` on REST fetches for resilience.
- **Cookie banner is in a shadow DOM** (Usercentrics) and sets `overflowHidden` on `<body>`, blocking scroll until dismissed. Only relevant to the browser fallback — click "Accept All" by coordinates, then clear the class / set `body.style.overflow='auto'`.
